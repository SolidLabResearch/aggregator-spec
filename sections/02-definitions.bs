Definitions {#definitions}
===================================

This section defines terminology used throughout this specification. Where applicable, terms are aligned with external 
specifications such as WebID Profiles [[!WEBID-PROFILE]], OpenID Connect (OIDC) [[!OIDC-Core]], OAuth 2.0 [[RFC6749]], and 
User-Managed Access (UMA) [[!UMA]].

Core Roles and Components {#definitions-core}
---------------------------------------------

- **Client:** An application acting on behalf of an end-user to create Aggregator Instances and configure Aggregator 
    Services.

- **Aggregator Server:** The server deployment that exposes public discovery metadata and a registration API used to create 
    and manage Aggregator Instances.

- **Aggregator Instance** (or “Aggregator”): A user- or tenant-scoped logical instance created via the registration 
    endpoint. An instance exposes an Aggregator Description and an authenticated management API for configuring services.

- **Aggregator Service** (or “Service”): A configured data processing pipeline inside an Aggregator Instance. A service is 
    represented as an FnO execution (`fno:Execution`) that identifies the executed function and its inputs; outputs are 
    described by the function's output parameters (see [[#aggregator-service-management]]).

- **Transformation Catalog:** A catalog that describes the transformations supported by the Aggregator Server or Aggregator 
    Instance (see [[#server-level-transformation-catalog]] and [[#instance-level-transformation-catalog]]).

Identity, Authorization, and Tokens {#definitions-security}
----------------------------------------------------------

- **User (End-user):** A person or agent that owns or controls resources and uses a Client to configure an Aggregator 
    deployment.

- **WebID:** An HTTP(S) IRI that identifies an agent and can be dereferenced to obtain a WebID Profile document mainly to 
    discover the user's IdP (defined in [[!WEBID-PROFILE]]).

- **Identity Provider (IdP):** An OpenID Connect Provider following the OIDC spec ([[!OIDC-Core]]) that authenticates a user 
    based on it's userID and issues ID tokens used by this protocol during registration and authorization workflows.

- **Authorization Server (AS):** An OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server that supports UMA as defined in ([[!A4DS]]) and issues 
    Requesting Party Tokens (RPTs) for protected resources.

- **Resource Server (RS):** An HTTP server that hosts protected resources. In UMA terminology, a Resource Server protects 
    resources and interacts with an Authorization Server to obtain UMA tickets and validate RPTs.

- **UMA Ticket:** A value returned in a `WWW-Authenticate: UMA ...` challenge when a client requests a protected resource 
    without sufficient authorization. The client presents the ticket to the Authorization Server to obtain an RPT.

- **Requesting Party Token (RPT):** An OAuth 2.0 token issued by an Authorization Server under UMA that encodes 
    permissions/scopes for a protected resource (see [[RFC6750]]).

- **ID Token:** An OpenID Connect ID token representing the authenticated user (and, depending on the deployment, 
    the client). The protocol uses ID tokens as claim tokens in UMA exchanges and during registration flows as described in 
    [[#aggregator-security-model]].

- **Client ID Document:** A dereferenceable client metadata document that follows the OAuth Client ID Metadata 
    Document specification [[!Client-ID]].

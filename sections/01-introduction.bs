Introduction {#introduction}
====================

This specification defines the Aggregator Protocol, an HTTP-based interface that lets a client create and manage Aggregator Instances and configure Aggregator Services that execute data transformations.
Transformations are described and discovered using the Function Ontology (FnO) [[!FNO]]; a service is configured by referencing a transformation (a `fno:Execution`) and providing its parameters, after which the client can retrieve the derived result from the output defined by that function.

Clients start from the Aggregator Server Description at the server base URL to discover the registration endpoint, supported registration flows, and the server’s transformation catalog ([[#aggregator-server-metadata]]).
Using the registration endpoint, a client creates (or manages) an Aggregator Instance ([[#aggregator-registration]]) and then follows the instance’s Aggregator Description to find the instance’s service collection and transformations endpoint ([[#aggregator-description]] and [[#aggregator-service-management]]).

All management operations are authenticated and authorized.
This protocol integrates with OpenID Connect [[!OIDC-Core]] for identity and uses UMA-style authorization [[!UMA]] for protected resources, scopes, and tickets as described in [[#aggregator-security-model]].

Servers MUST support JSON (`application/json`) where specified and MAY additionally provide semantically annotated RDF representations (e.g., JSON-LD or Turtle) via HTTP content negotiation.
The Aggregator vocabulary ([[#vocabulary]]) provides stable IRIs for classes and predicates used throughout the specification.
